Basic ML classification workflow using Naive Bayes for email spam detection
# Email Spam Classification using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates a complete basic machine learning classification workflow
using a practical example of email spam detection.

The goal is to show how raw text data is converted into numerical features,
how a model is trained, evaluated, and how data size affects performance.

## Model Used
- Multinomial Naive Bayes
- CountVectorizer for text feature extraction

## Workflow Steps
1. Create a labeled email dataset (spam / ham)
2. Convert text data into numerical form using CountVectorizer
3. Split data into training and testing sets
4. Train a Naive Bayes classifier
5. Evaluate model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
6. Expand the dataset to show improvement in evaluation stability

## Key Learning
The model remains the same, but increasing data size improves
evaluation reliability and performance metrics.

## Video Demonstration
The submitted video explains:
- The full ML workflow step by step
- Why small datasets cause unstable metrics
- How expanding the dataset improves results
- Real-world relevance of spam classification

This project is meant for educational and demonstration purposes.
